# Bamazon-CLI-App
UofR Bootcamp Week 12 HW

-BAmazon is an Amazon-like storefront concept application built using nodeJS and MySQL.

# Description 
-BAmazon was built to simulate basic storefront activities. These activities currently include viewing all products, and completing transactions from a 'Customer view'.

-I will also be adding functionality to this application over time to include a 'Manager view' and 'Supervisor view'. These views will give end users with manager and or supervisor credentials to manage inventory.

# Usage Overview
-This app currently will display item descriptions, price, and the current inventory of all product in the store. The end user is then prompted to choose an item for purchase and quantity. The app will then calculate the total of the purchase and then deduct the total from the credit card on file in the system.

-Please feel free to view images of the app's functionality. Images are located in the images folder located in the root of this repository
